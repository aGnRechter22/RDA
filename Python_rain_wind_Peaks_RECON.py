'''Hello, let me introduce myself.

   My name is Alexander Rechter and I am studying Physics at LION at Leiden University and focus myself primarily on research in
   experimental physics. My main interests are not in physics however, they are in the field of meteorology and understanding and
   quantizing the weather using physics. Not only is my goal to help society I also love to contribute to science and generally keep
   myself busy with doing science and having fun in it.
   
   The python code you have opened in front of you now is what I am currently working on. This is only 4% of the entire future system of codes.
   This is called the "Python_peaks_RECON"-module and allows the analyst to determine where the minima and maxima of pressure are located in the dataset.
   It can be used to analyse data from the hurricane hunters as it comes in live and does not require the guessing and estimating by eye as most
   of you are used to. It also eliminates the need for CKZ and other relationships for most part as it takes the data from the center right during
   the heat of the event so to speak.
   
   Throughout the code I have sprinkled some other docstrings for you to read to understand the code better and make proper use of it.
   
   Disclaimer: I am not responsible for any problems you or your computer might experience when running this code. 
               It is your own responsibility to use the code responsibly and not abuse it for pushing your computer to the limit.
               If you do, it is your own risk. So I hereby urge you to be careful and make sure you do not randomly remove parts of the code.
               



    I hope you will have a lot of fun with the code and use it responsibly. I hope it will be useful and for any questions please contact me via:
        s3794180@vuw.leidenuniv.nl or agnrechter@gmail.com for inquiries about the code. My discord tag is @disaster_0125 and username NuclearPastaPhys.
        Feel free to contact me anytime and I will hopefully respond within 1-2 working days.
        

GOOD LUCK!

'''Alright I see you like coding in Python. So here we have the part that makes it possible to plot the time labels on the x-axis.
    
    Let's take a tour.
    
    The x_ticks_positions function makes it possible to adjust how many labels we want to be plotted. Keep the number small as otherwise..
    ..it would be unreadable and well that is just not something my heart skips a beat for.
    
    The x_ticks_labels function makes it possible to generate the labels. Please do not touch. Thank you very much.
    
    Instructions of how to use it: See comment.

'''This part of the code is for the hardcore physical programming nerds.

    Let's take a tour together.
    
    So we start with the function that prints the data from the "troughs" in the data. That are those small valleys you see until it hits the minima.
    I defined it as local/absolute minima as two put together makes one a local the other absolute. For one single pass it is the absolute minimum and then there are..
    two local maxima. 
    
    Hope that that makes it clear.
    
    Next up we have the part of the code that makes it possible to print the additional information we might want to know
    about the storm. Such as the latitudes and longitudes of these observations and how far the plane has travelled to the next pass,
    which can be used to determine how fast the hurricane hunters flew on average.
    
    This average flight speed can then be used in error analysis so any potential pressure measurement mistakes due to the plane's velocity can be..
    filtered out and thus would result in valid data. So keep in mind it is still RAW.
