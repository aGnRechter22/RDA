Data Analysis using Python of the data gathered during missions for the hurricane hunters for both tropical and non-tropical cyclones!

I do want to stress you should read the docstrings and if my work is used please do cite and or inform me of it so I can improve my own work and 
that we, as a scientific community as a whole, will be able to move forward and advance science further.

May curiosity lead the way.

See below for the preliminary schedule of coding yet to be done:
Enjoy module 1 of soon to be many of my python code.

Have fun for who wants to (:

It only processes raw pressure data from RECON as of right now.

What to expect from me?

UPDATE: STUDY RELATED DELAYS ARE HAPPENING SO IT MIGHT TAKE A WHILE BEFORE I PUBLISH A REFINED CODE

- Winds module will come somewhere in 2 weeks or so
This contains:
 - Filtered SFMR (removed flags in Fourier transformed data) data

- Temperature and Dewpoint (combined module) will come in the next month somewhere

Pressure_Regression_Module
- Linear Regression for minimum center pressure Module
- Best-Fit cosh regression for the minimum pressure
- Best fit non-linear regression method for finding the minimum pressure, probs use Knaff's publications as a resource.
- CKZ regression for minimum pressure

I hope you guys are just as excited as I am for this project
